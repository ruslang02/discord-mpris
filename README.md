# Discord Rich Presence client for MPRIS players

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

**Warning!** Requires a user account token and a Rich Presence app on <https://discordapp.com/developers/applications>.
**Beware!** Using a user account token in bot-like software is against Discord ToS, we don't take responsibility for any accounts banned, proceed at your own risk.

Comparing to `discordrp-mpris` enables user to display currently playing album covers instead of the app's icon.

Currently tested on [YouTube Music app for Nuvola Apps Service](https://nuvola.tiliado.eu/app/youtube_music), may (and most likely will not) work with any other music apps as of now.

## TODO
 - Support for other media players
 - Option to use without custom album covers feature
 - Support for restarting/reconnecting/error handling
